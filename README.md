# Keploy
Keploy is a no-code API testing platform that generates tests-cases and data-mocks from API calls.

Dependency-mocks are automatically generated with the recorded request/responses.

> Keploy is testing itself with &nbsp;  [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/keploy/keploy/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/keploy/keploy?branch=main) &nbsp;  without writing any test-cases and data-mocks. üòé

## Quick Start
The fastest way to start with Keploy is the Gitpod-hosted version. When you're ready, you can install locally or host yourself.

One-click deploy sample URL Shortener application sample with Keploy using Gitpod

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/keploy/samples-go)

## Features
**Convert API calls from any source to Test-Case** : Keploy captures all the API calls and subsequent network traffic served by the application. You can use any existing API management tools like Postman, Hoppscotch, Curl to generate test-case.

* **Automatically Mocks Dependencies**
* **Safely Replays all CRUD operations**

**Native interoperability** with popular testing libraries like `go-test`. Code coverage will be reported with existing and Keploy recorded test cases and can also be integrated in CI pipelines/infrastructure.

## Other Features

* **Accurate Noise Detection** in responses like (timestamps, random values) to ensure high quality tests.
* **Statistical deduplication** ensures that redundant testcases are not generated. WIP (ref [#27](https://github.com/keploy/keploy/issues/27)).
* **Web Console** to visually understand the results, update behaviour and share findings across your team.

## How it works?

![How it works](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keploy/docs/main/static/img/how-it-works.png)

Keploy is added as a middleware to your application that captures and replays all network interaction served to application from any source.

## Installation
### Start keploy server
```shell
git clone https://github.com/keploy/keploy.git && cd keploy
docker-compose up
```
The UI can be accessed at http://localhost:8081

### Helm chart
Keploy can also be installed to your Kubernetes cluster using the Helm chart available [here](deployment/keploy)

### Run Sample application
Demos using Echo/PostgreSQL and Gin/MongoDB are available [here](https://github.com/keploy/samples-go). For this example, we will use the Echo/PostgreSQL sample.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-go && cd samples-go/echo-sql
go mod download
```

#### Start PostgreSQL instance
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Run the application
```shell
go run handler.go main.go
```

### Generate testcases
To genereate testcases we just need to make some API calls. You can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/), or simply `curl`

#### 1. Generate shortned url
```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8080/url \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "url": "https://github.com"
}'
```
this will return the shortened url. The ts would automatically be ignored during testing because it'll always be different.
```json
{
	"ts": 1647802058801841100,
	"url": "http://localhost:8080/GuwHCgoQ"
}
```
#### 2. Redirect to original url from shortened url
```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:8080/GuwHCgoQ
```

### Integration with native Go test framework
You just need 3 lines of code in your unit test file and that's it!!üî•üî•üî•
```go
import (
	"github.com/keploy/go-sdk/keploy"
	"testing"
)
func TestKeploy(t *testing.T) {
	keploy.SetTestMode()
	go main()
	keploy.AssertTests(t)
}
```

### Run the testcases
**Note: Before running tests stop the sample application**
```shell
go test -coverpkg=./... -covermode=atomic  ./...
```
this should show you have 74.4% coverage without writing any code!
```shell
ok      echo-psql-url-shortener 5.820s  coverage: 74.4% of statements in ./...
```

All of these can be visualised here - http://localhost:8081/testlist
