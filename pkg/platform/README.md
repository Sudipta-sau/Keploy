# Platform Package Documentation

This package exposes a set of interfaces and methods for common data 
store operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting 
(CRUD) records.

Implementations for different types of data stores can be added 
here, all in one place. These implementations are abstracted from 
other logic using interface methods.

This package depends on the `models` package, using its structs to 
perform the CRUD operations.
