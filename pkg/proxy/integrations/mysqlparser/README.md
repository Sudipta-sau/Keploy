# MySQL Package Documentation

The `mysqlparser` package encompasses the parser and mapping logic required 
to read MySql binary messages and capture and test the outputs. 
Utilized by the `hooks` package, it assists in redirecting outgoing 
calls for the purpose of recording or testing the outputs.
